# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1

## You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. 


### Day 0: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Built structure (HTML) for a form page.

**Thoughts:** I felt this was quite easy. The only challenging part was what HTML attributes to use while creating the form page. I realized the CSS won't be this easy though.

**Coding time:** 60 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 1: August 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on form styling using CSS.

**Thoughts:** It was quite intimidating at first, because I didn't know which attributes to use. There are so many of them. But I decided to not fall into analysis paralysis and started to use the most common attributes and dive right in. Overall it was quite a relief knowing I had understood some CSS topics such as box model, etc. I hope to learn more by doing and getting hands-on experience, without being afraid that I would fail.

**Coding time:** Around 30 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 2: August 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on form CSS, studied other similar form structures.

**Thoughts:** My first session today, I got confused which attributes I should add because there are so many. I will do another one in the afternoon. I think my form is done.

**Coding time:** Around 45 minutes.

<hr>
### I missed a day. 21/8 was supposed to be my day 3 of 100 days of code but I forgot about it. I won't miss twice.
<hr>

### Day 3: August 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started exploring web development subject such as web layouts and display. Learned CSS floats and flexbox. Still copied other people's code but I managed to tweak something here and there, and noticing what happens when I tweak something. I learn by experimenting.

**Thoughts:** Today will be my introduction to deeper CSS subjects such as floats, flexbox, and grid. I've come across an SCSS code today and I felt amazed by the things it can do. What I felt today was something like being lost, then seeing a way out in the distance. I know the things I should do to make progress, whether I make it through or not will depend on my own consistency and will.

**Coding time:** Around 75 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 4: August 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I put the theories I learned yesterday into practice. I created my own content website with a proper website layout using float property. 

**Thoughts:** Today I finally get to move away from theories and gained practical experience. It was hard to start, but once I got going I was not in the mood to stop. I made significant progress in learning basic CSS today. I also made lateral progress by learning to use icons, using target attributes, experimenting with the layout, box sizing, playing with margins & padding, and much more. I now know why learning by doing is the most effective method of learning. No amount of online courses will bring me the same progress at the same pace.


**Coding time:** Around 80 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 5: August 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Made updates on websites. Learned about HTML Semantics and Structuring. Made the template code for other pages and added some css to them.

**Thoughts:** I felt that progress was quite slow today. It's expected though. I hope to make more significant progress in the future. I also noticed that I haven't made my website responsive yet. It seems like I will be working on the page for some time in the future.


**Coding time:** Around 60 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 6: August 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today's progress was incremental. I read about guides on font styling and experimented with fonts and block elements.

**Thoughts:** This is where the fun starts. Progress won't come as easily like yesterday. I spent the first half of today's session reading materials. I spent the latter half on experimenting. I caught a bug where my footer gets stuck in the middle of my content element. I don't know what to do. I've tried clear: both, to no avail. I suspect there's something wrong fundamentally about my page's layout. I'll check it again tomorrow.

**Learning time:** Around 40 minutes.

**Coding time:** Around 30 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 7: August 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Moved on to another subject: flexbox. Started working the structure of web page using flexboxes.

**Thoughts:** I decided to move on to another topic: flexbox. I felt that float was insufficient to layout a page, because of some of it's characteristics. Most developers doesn't use float anyways. I decided that in order to get the best ROI for my time, I'd have to move on from this subject. So I did.

**Coding time:** Around 35 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 8: August 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned the theory behind flexbox. I read the materials quite a lot today. Learned flexbox's layout properties and its corresponding values. I used learning source code to see flexbox in action.

**Thoughts:** I realized that I can't just dive right into a material. I must first learn some basics required in order to make something out of it. From this session, I hope to gain a sense of familiarity with flexbox. My short term goal is to be able to layout a page using flexbox without looking at other people's code.

**Coding time:** 45 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 9: August 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Did exercises on flexbox for navigation bars. Learned @media rules and how to create a responsive navigation bar. 

**Thoughts:** I encountered some new materials today. Namely, @media rules, and flexbox child properties. Today I get to add depth to my flexbox knowledge. I'm starting to think I might be doing this too slowly. But since I don't have any concrete reason to rush things, I'll learn things at just the right pace.

**Coding time:** 35 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 10: August 29, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Resumed my flexbox-based content website. I managed to explore new properties that makes a website better looking. I also managed to further my understanding about structuring, and basic layouts by experimenting with properties and their values.

**Thoughts:** Today was fun. I was feeling a bit lazy at first, but after a bit of work I managed to get into a focused state that enables me to make progress.

**Coding time:** 55 minutes.

### Day 11: August 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Moved on to another important topic: Grids. Today I signed up on a grid mini-course. I installed the necessary software and files in order to do the course properly. I finished video 2 out of 25.

**Thoughts:** Today was quite boring. I was only learning materials for today. So no coding here. Tomorrow, I'll dive into the mini-course's main course.

**Reading time:** 40 minutes.

### Day 12: August 31, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned the fundamentals of CSS Grid and explored Mozilla's Development Browser DevTools.

**Thoughts:** I got my first glimpse of grids today. It was awesome. It's way simpler than flexbox, not to mention more intuitive too. I don't think I'm going back to flexbox after seeing grids in action! Long live the grid.

Thoughts 2: I'll probably make a python file to automate these log entries, later. Too lazy to copy and paste em all.

**Coding time:** 45 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 13: September 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned implicit/explicit tracks, the grid-auto-flow property, sizing tracks in CSS using fr units, the repeat() function and chaining grid item sizing,  and learned to size grid items (occupying multiple rows and/or columns) using the grid-row and grid-column property.

**Thoughts:** Today went well. I still feel bored because I had to follow a course, it reminds me of udemy. But I have to agree that courses like these are very information dense. I suppose the best way to learn might be to combine a practical (trial and error) approach and a structured approach.

**Coding time:** 30 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 14: September 2, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued further on CSS grids. I learned to place grid items within the grid 2D structure, using the auto-fit auto-fill values and minmax() method, how to create a responsive website with grids, and learned to use grid-template-areas property.

**Thoughts:** I'm a huge fan of grids right now. I don't think I'll be going back to flexbox after seeing grids in action. They're simple yet powerful. Huge websites can be built based on grids alone. I'm really liking CSS right now.

**Coding time:** 65 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 15: September 3, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned to use line naming, using dense value for grid-auto-flow, and item & content alignment.

**Thoughts:** Today I just wasn't feeling it. I pushed on anyways. I'm still confused about the alignment part. I'll probably learn more through experimenting rather than by watching videos about it.

**Coding time:** 40 minutes.

### Day 16: September 4, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned to nest grid items and learned the use cases for flexbox and grids.

**Thoughts:** Today I was not efficient. I think it's about time I start to work on projects. I'll skip to the last 2 videos for tomorrow, and get started with my real project involving grids.

**Coding time:** 80 minutes.

### Day 17: September 5, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about responsive website design.

**Thoughts:** I was confused and lost. At some point within the video, I got lost and something just doesn't click. I'm currently having a hard time following the tutorial. I'll try again tomorrow morning.

### Day 18: September 6, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I followed the course on responsive website design.

**Thoughts:** Today was much better than yesterday. I understood most of the working parts of the website, however there were some parts that felt abstract in a way (because I've never used them). But I can say that I managed to follow the course thoroughly.

**Coding time:** 160 minutes.

### Day 21: September 9, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Did some planning with my co-author about the blog's website and design. Today was mostly on planning ahead and making the about section in the homepage.

**Thoughts:** Today was filled with meetings. It was ok though. Tomorrow, I'll finish the homepage with footers and add responsivity to it.

**Coding time:** 50 minutes.

### Day 22: September 10, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Did the footer for our first blog. I learned important things, such as CSS logic and website layouts.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy I could do this at my own, comfortable pace. I tweaked things here and there, and found the best layout for me.

**Coding time:** 60 minutes.

### Day 23: September 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today was a bust. Initially, I had tried to make the home page a bit better and move on to create the "Contact Us" section. However, I encountered technical issued when styling the home page and got stuck. It's clear that my technical knowledge is still insufficient for making next-level website layouts. 

**Thoughts:** As of this point, most of my code had been produced with trial-and-error. I know, that's not a good way to code. I had encountered a problem that revealed my lack of technical knowledge. I had been learning about CSS for quite some time now, but I'm still not used to it's logic. I must go back to the basics. I will dedicate this weekend for learning the basics. That includes: positioning, display, box model, grids, flexboxes, and responsive design. I will drop the project for some time and strengthen my CSS fundamentals.

**Coding time:** 60 minutes.

<hr>

### Day 24: September 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today was okay. I managed to understand CSS Positioning. I learned to center things using various methods through CSS. I did the practice problems from youtube videos and websites.

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy I can actually understand the basics. I usually get stuck when situations like these arise, but now I'm feeling confident that I am capable. I'll stick with this, and see if anything great comes out of it.

**Coding time:** 60 minutes.

### Day 41: October 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on problems about Basic Algorithms.


**Thoughts:** Today was quite rough. I had moments where I got stuck on designing the algorithm. I also had moments when I completely don't know what to do next, fixed some code here and there, and somehow, in some way, the code magically runs. The feeling is unique, to say the least. Most devs can relate to that though. Lol.

**Coding time:** 80 minutes.

### Day 42: October 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on website, and decided the future of the website.


**Thoughts:** It's clear that I do not have the necessary technical abilities to create a full-fledged website, complete with its responsiveness and cross-compatibility, optimization, features, etc. Since the website was going to be a blog-like site, we have decided that it's best (for now) to launch a website ASAP using Wordpress and start writing. I will still be continuing the original website, I will be tweaking it here and there as I go deeper into front end development. 

**Coding time:** 60 minutes.

### Day 45: October 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned JavaScript event loop and asynchronous JS


**Thoughts:** This one's tough. I didn't quite understood the lesson from JSConf. I understood some parts of The event loop, but I still haven't grasped the topic fully. I'm also having difficulties visualizing the flow of async JS. I think I need to revisit promises and callbacks.

**Coding time:** 60 minutes.

### Day 46: October 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks and promises), Event loop, and also the flow of execution stack and execution context.


**Thoughts:** Today I made progress. Now I understand how Promises work, and I'm able to understand what the code actually does. I also learned basics such as event loops, execution stack, and execution context.

**Thoughts:** -
<hr>

### Day 93: January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create API requests using axios, React's refs, and used them to make a Pinterest-like app. 

**Thoughts:** It was fun learning how to make a real app like this one
<hr>

### Day 94: January 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and built components using those Hooks.

**Thoughts:** Hooks was fun. I think I kinda like function components more now, because of their cleanliness and simplicity.
<hr>

### Day 95: January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a search app that uses Wikipedia API and utilized React Function Components using Hooks.

**Thoughts:** Today was mostly tinkering the code, brought errors several times but it was probably my mistake tho
<hr>

### Day 96: January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Caught a problem about making the API request efficiently. To not make unecessary API calls, it seemed like I needed to create a timeout function for each letter as they're typed and cancel the timeout each time another letter is entered.

**Thoughts:** I get to work on problem solving for today, it was ok.
<hr>

### Day 97: January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Tinkered around with useEffect's cleanup function and how it's used to create a search bar functionality. I also learned about "debouncing", and I managed to resolve debouncing bugs by creating two separate useEffects that watches two different pieces of state. This will minimize the bugs in the code.

**Thoughts:** I think useEffect's cleanup function is pretty cool. It reminds me of Class Component's componentWillUnmount().
<hr>

### Day 98: January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a dropdown menu, added toggle features so it can close/open. This was just regular practice for creating components.

**Today's Progress**: Wrapping my head around a UX problem that arose, also I reviewed a bit on event bubbling.

**Thoughts:** Mainly a streak keeper. Tomorrow's the 100th day already?
<hr>

### Day 100: January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned how event bubbling works on React event listeners vs DOM event listeners, implemented the solution to yesterday's problem using React's useRef Hook. Used useEffect's cleanup function to remove callback functions for removed components. Finished Dropdown component.

**Thoughts:** Round 1 is a wrap! Granted, this round wasn't perfect. But, at least, it's a start of something bigger.
