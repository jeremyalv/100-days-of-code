# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2

## The most important thing is to show up every day.

### Day 101: January 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Translate component that's gonna be used for translating words from a wide range of languages available.

**Thoughts:** Building this translate component will be fun.
<hr>

### Day 102: January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Translate Component. Used Google's Translation API and implemented a debouncing feature to lighten server load from incoming API requests.

**Thoughts:** So happy these widgets are done. Debouncing was an interesting topic, maybe I'll use it for my next project.

<hr>

### Day 103: January 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished all widgets, added navigation and used Routing concepts to improve navigation experience and performance.

**Thoughts:** It was really fun learning how to use routing to add a navigation feature in react. Learned a lot.

<hr>

### Day 104: January 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started work on an e-commerce website that's gonna be built using React and PHP as backend. This is part of a school project.

**Thoughts:** Today I get to apply the concepts I learned yesterday into practice. I did many trial-and-errors today, tinkering around here and there. It's helping me to learn as fast as possible.

<hr>

### Day 105: January 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created header for e-commerce project.

**Thoughts:** I'm still finding layouting to be quite a challenge.
<hr>

### Day 106: January 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned Material UI for React, learned about it's basic features such as how to use its components, how to change default themes, and how to specify our own styles.

**Thoughts:** I realized that if I want to do this project, I will have to learn how to use libraries like Material UI.  I also need to strengthen my layouting and responsive design skills (mobile-first approach). This will probably take longer than expected, excited tho (who's rushing?).
<hr>

### Day 107: January 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Flexbox, and finished E-Commerce Header! It's looking sleek now.

**Thoughts:** Now I'm starting to have a sense of control over these UI Tools. Finished Header and felt great!

<hr>

### Day 109: January 24, 2021

**Thoughts:** Mainly a streak keeper, cause I believe that something is better than nothing.
<hr>

### Day 110: January 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started work on a youtube-like app.

**Thoughts:** Another practice to help me get comfortable with React
<hr>

### Day 111: January 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Page Layouting

**Thoughts:** Tinkering around with things really helps to get those concepts inside your mind
<hr>

### Day 112: January 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Page Layouting

**Thoughts:** Could've put in more time today.
<hr>

### Day 113: January 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Video App

**Thoughts:** Got stuck on a 403 error today. I'll look into it again tomorrow.
<hr>

### Day 114: January 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 on bug fixing, still couldn't resolve the error. 

**Thoughts:** I tried asking on online forums today, let's see if it will help..
<hr>

### Day 115: January 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed CSS positioning.

**Thoughts:** I get to solidify the concepts of CSS in the last couple of days.
<hr>

### Day 116: January 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Resolved bug. FINALLY!

**Thoughts:** Whew. It seemes like the bug was caused by a wrong configuration in the Youtube API settings. It was an uneccessary mistake, but at least it's solved.
<hr>

### Day 117: February 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Youtube Clone

**Thoughts:** I was quite busy today so I wasn't able to put in as much time as I hoped.
<hr>

### Day 118: February 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Youtube Clone

**Thoughts:** I was busy, hence why today's session was only meant as a streak keeper. I just need to not lose momentum.
<hr>

### Day 119: February 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Explored Material UI's ecosystem.

**Thoughts:** I needed to further explore this library if I'm gonna be able to use it well. Also, I have to admit that these last few days haven't been too great. I feel less inclined to do the things I know I should do. At least I didn't break the chain..
<hr>

### Day 120: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did major improvements in youtube clone app, explored styling methods using libraries like Emotion.js.

**Thoughts:** I put in coding hours early in the day and I'm back on track. Experimented with different approaches to styling and finished the videos list component of the App. I just came across Emotion.js when looking for a solution to use pseudo selectors in JSX. This will be fun. Also, I'm still wondering why NPM couldn't work properly on my machine... I guess I'll have to stick with yarn for now.

<hr>

### Day 121: February 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Because I'm currently following a course, I'm continuing my progress on the lessons. Yesterday I had experimented with creating the Youtube App originated from my own creativity. Today I "crosschecked" with the main course and see how things could be done differently.

**Thoughts:** I honestly think this method of learning works well. It's like when you're given a problem and you do it by yourself first, then checking the answers for that question. Of course, I know that just following a course blindly won't lead me anywhere, hence the occasional tinkering around. Oh and, of course I saved my "tinkering around" code yesterday in a new branch ;) Maybe I'll make my own version of the App when I complete the course.
<hr>

### Day 122: February 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Super busy today, so this was just a way of keeping the chain unbroken.

**Thoughts:** Coded for like, 5 minutes. At least I didn't break the chain.
<hr>

### Day 123: February 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added youtube videos embed for app.

**Thoughts:** Today was ok.
<hr>

### Day 124: February 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Youtube App, and started work on refactoring the App using React Hooks

**Thoughts:** I have found that attempting to solve a problem on your own instead of jumping right into a tutorial or course to know the answer **greatly** improves retention of materials. Took me a while to figure out that active learning always beats passive learning, especially in this case.

<hr>

### Day 125: February 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Refactored Youtube App using Hooks.

**Thoughts:** Learned from yesterday's mistakes and got a clearer picture on using React.
<hr>

### Day 126: February 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created my own custom Hooks.

**Thoughts:** Was mainly to not break the chain.
<hr>

### Day 127: February 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Used the previously created custom Hook and learned how to integrate it with a component.

**Thoughts:** Definitely need to step up.
<hr>

### Day 128: February 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Priming on **Redux**, learned HTML Encoding and solved the "un-encoded" text problem on Youtube Clone, styled Youtube Clone, and "Feynman-ed" the flow of the Youtube App.

**Thoughts:** Coded for 4+ hours today. I made progress on understanding the Youtube App further. Explored Redux's ecosystem and learned how it works. I also improved the Youtube Clone App Styling. Unfortunately, I have met the Google API's Daily API Calls Quota, so I can't upload screenshots right now.

<hr>

### Day 129: February 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Redux Concept Visualization. Learned the flow of data on Redux (action creators create action Object. When Action Obj. gets dispatched, a Reducer function "process" the data and algorithmically decides what to do with the data. All of it ends at the State that gets updated when a Reducer function notifies the state of updated data.)

**Thoughts:** Today was okay.

### Day 135: February 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Not much, but I learned about the Provider and Connect component on Redux.

**Thoughts:** Things are getting busy lately. I still need to wrap my head around the connect function.
<hr>

### Day 136: February 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Intro to using connect function from react-redux

**Thoughts:** Still a streak keeper, just trying not to break the habit. For the past week I haven't been able to code as much as I want to. I'll need to think about next week's plan.
<hr>

### Day 137: February 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Configured connect with mapStateToProps

**Thoughts:** I did the bare minimum just to keep the habit going. Busy days are behind me now.

**Today's Progress**: Took a quiz on how Redux works by writing code for a simple counter using Redux.. it seemed like I gained a lot of insight from completing that. 

**Thoughts:** Momentum is back. Hopefully I'll keep increasing coding time little by little.
<hr>

## WeWatch 2.0 - Project Incoming

### Day 141: February 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read a lot on a wide variety of topics, but I didn't code for today because I wanted to gain breadth of knowledge on different topics (especially backend). Learned about OS and process management, backend 101, and redux 101.

**Thoughts:** I feel kinda lost now. I will begin "reinventing" past projects shortly and integrate the topics I've learned, since I'll have more time in the next few days.
<hr>

### Day 142: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: WeWatch v2 Project Planning

**Thoughts:** the planning took more time than expected, but I'm not rushing anyways
<hr>

### Day 143: February 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: WeWatch v2 Master Planning: Defined main features, expanded details on main features, learned how to properly plan and make a web app on my own. 

**Thoughts:** This one will take a while, but I'm excited. I'm about to venture into back end development as well, as I might add features that require the use of databases and authentication. I'll also learn how to prototype and design through this project. Though it's a youtube clone, I'm not gonna underestimate the effort it'll require. Redux learning WILL BE PAUSED, and I'll dedicate my attention to this project. Tomorrow I'll make the app sketch and add details. Here goes. 
<hr>

### Day 144: February 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created sketches for App Views (Profile, Startup, Searched, and Streaming View)
